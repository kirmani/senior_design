TODO(kirmani): DESCRIPTION GOES HERE

List of tests we are running:
- spawn cylinder
- spawn box
- spawn kitcnen counter elevation and have it go up
- spawn corner by wall w/ half FOV
- spawn in laundry room
- spawn under table, avoids legs?
- spawn free space in laundry room
- spawn go between couches
- spawn inside kitchen

#how much stuff has already been done

# stuff I need to do:
# set goal
# set starting position
# run the thing ?? not so sure
# (later) set up environment
# check if step terminated and check reward

# know when drone has collided
# set goal:
# self.nav_goal.position.x = goal_position[0]
# self.nav_goal.position.y = goal_position[1]
# self.nav_goal.position.z = goal_position[2]

# set start position (from sim rand)
